# Introduction

## Problem Statement

In diversity we believe.

During the past years, we all witnessed the exploding growth of the digital content industry led by a variety of web content platforms and mobile apps, such as Reddit, Youtube and Spotify. As the developer of CastBox, we are glad to see the great achievements made by all players in this area; however, we cannot deny the fact that the __prosperity__ and __diversity__ of the whole industry are still suffering from several long-standing problems:

+ **Central censorship.** Some may argue that the central censorship is necessary to filter spam and build a healthy online community and totally legal in many countries. However, in today's world where we are all connected by the Internet, censorship is becoming more and more counterproductive, not only because it kills diversity by preventing us from discussing the censored topic, but also because it cannot eliminate real spams effectively under the circumstances of the explosion of user-generated contents. 

+ **The decisive role of distributors.** There are many stakeholders in the digital content area: artists, consumers, investors, advertisers and distributors. It is well known that the distributors are playing the most important role in today's ecosystem, especially those big web or mobile content platforms such as Youtube or Spotify. They are holding large amount of web traffic and they decide how to dispatch the traffic. Compared with the central large platform, both creators and audiences are in weak position and lack of bargain power when discussing the monetization and payout mechanisms. Therefore, as we can see, most of the revenue will be taken by the platform and most content creators can just collect a small part of the pie. On the other hand, the high traffic acquisition cost of the central platform will be transferred to the content consumers. They either have to pay unfair subscription fees or tolerate longer and longer ad clips.

+ **Poor protection for original contents and real creators.** IP piracy continues to be a headache for the digital content industry. In some markets, consumers have developed an expectation that digital content should be free or priced low, putting downward pressure on pricing of subscriptions. Audio or video content, either curated by professionals or generated by normal users, is available in an array of easily accessible forms, including through online downloads, purchase on USB devices, and conversion into files from YouTube videos. Just take a look at those who move video clips from Youtube to local video platforms and garner a number of fans in this way, anyone will realize how severe this problem is. The future of the industry is doomed if we cannot stop this kind of piracy behavior.

## A Blockchain-based Ecosystem: ContentBox

Our solution to the problems mentioned above is a blockchain-based ecosystem: ContentBox. 

Unlike the traditional open platforms, such as App Store or Wechat Open Platform[^fn6], ContentBox is fully __decentralized, autonomous, and driven by the open source community instead of a giant firm in the industry__. By leveraging the blockchain as an open, immutable, distributed, and temper-proof database, web or mobile content platforms can share rights data without ceding control to a third party. Fast on-chain settlement of transactions will also help a creator to gain his share directly when an audience browse and consume his artwork in an app. 

In principle, ContentBox is designed to benefit all participants in the industry, including but not limited to, internet scale platforms, creators, app developers and normal audiences, allowing them to collaborate, innovate and build new generation of digital content applications that play on fair terms. 

For content creators, they now have a better protection for their IP rights and will get paid more for their artworks; for content consumers, they can watch a TV show or listen to a lecture without being subscribed to any specific service (they can pay by the tokens they earned from contributing to the community); for those big distribution platforms, they will also benefit from lowering the traffic acquisition cost and IP purchase cost. ContentBox can even bring benefits to the investors by allowing them to participate in many micro crowd-fundings started by various artists instead of betting large amount money on one project.

Even advertisers will gain benefits from the new ecosystem. With ContentBox, advertisers can tap into the shared content and user pool on the chain to build a unified and coherent marketing strategy, instead of running paralleled campaigns on different platforms. Furthermore, they can lower their spending by leveraging a token-based bounty program.

## The Foundation

To oversee the growth of the ContentBox Ecosystem, we have set up an entity the Contentbox Foundation in Singapore. The Foundation will administer the use of the proceeds and ensure the healthy circulation of the BOX token. Our ultimate goal is to build a fully decentralized and autonomous ecosystem for the digital content industry. Therefore, we would like to make the governance and operation of the Foundation as transparent as possible. As a matter of fact, we are planning to __build the Foundation as a totally software defined organization in the future__. 

As the founding member of the ContentBox Foundation, CastBox will pioneer the transition from a centralized app to a decentralized blockchain-based app and introduce BOX to its tens of millions of users. In the near future, CastBox will also open source the vast majority of its currently proprietary codebase after it integrates BOX into the app successfully, encouraging the open source community to drive the evolution of ContentBox.

# Uses of BOX as a Cryptocurrency

## Complementing Advertising with Token-based Reward System

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.48\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.36\textwidth]{images/channel}
    \caption{Spending BOX on specific content}
  \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}
Current content networks like YouTube rely heavily, if not exclusively, on advertisement for monetization. Consequently, only creators of the most popular content get paid, if at all. The rest of creators, despite contributing to most content vital to the network, are never financially recognized.

Using BOX, advertisers can still purchase BOX tokens to show advertisements as usual. In addition, content consumers can buy them as well for a variety of reasons. They can use them to access premium content. Or they can tip their favorite creators directly with tokens or virtual gifts purchase through tokens. No matter how large a fan base a creator has, be it 10 million or just 10, she could be economically compensated and thus is incentivized to produce more and better content, potentially bringing more fans. This positive synergy between creators and consumers has proven to boost network health and growth, as exemplified in Uplive[^fn7].

## Motivating Users to Distribute Content Actively

The value of a piece of content depends on its wide distribution. Traditionally, mainly content platforms actively participate. Under ContentBox, anyone disseminating content is rewarded with tokens. The larger audience she spreads the content to, the more rewards she reaps. By encouraging every user to distribute, contents can reach its viral potential.

## Filtering Spams

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.48\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.36\textwidth]{images/artboard}
  \caption{Earn BOX tokens by helping filter spams}
\end{wrapfigure}
If spamming is rampant in a content network, it will take users more time to find their interested content, degrading user experience. To combat this, average users can be compensated for flagging low quality content. Flagged content can then be reviewed to decide if they actually violate community policies. It is noteworthy that different from traditional flagging, users can earn tokens and thus will be more motivated to police the community.

## Lowering Content Acquisition Cost

Content distributors often acquire some content (e.g., a TV show) for their platform exclusively, hoping it will generate revenue after covering cost, which is not guaranteed. In ContentBox’s framework, contents are stored in a shared data layer, accessible across different distributors.
Content distributors pay for content by their actual, instead of projected, usage, which is recorded publicly and easily auditable and verifiable. This shared transparency will greatly reduce cost.

# Technology

## Why A New Platform?

The current mainstream blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are not a natural fit for the digital content industry due to the following reasons: 

+ **Long transaction delays & low throughput.** The digital content industry is quite different from finance or e-commerce world in terms of action frequency. Typically we might transfer our money or buy/sell goods several times a day, but on a digital content platform, a teenager might do way more actions, like streaming a song or watching a movie clip or tipping an article writer. In other words, we are expecting way larger transaction volume in the online digital content world. This trait of the digital content industry determines that current Bitcoin or Ethereum platform cannot meet the needs from real world, which leaves us no choice but to find novel solutions and build a new blockchain platform. 

+ **No privacy in smart contracts.** In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on the nodes of the blockchain, which introduces severe privacy problems. Due to the visibility of the contracts, a normal streamer's taste or preferences may be detected and published to a lot of people he may not know. Likewise, a content producer might also worry that his or her profit sharing plan be searched by outsiders and leaked to the public. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of smart contracts can bring security risks. We all know what happened to DAO.

+ **High transaction fees.** High transaction cost means there is no real micro-payment; and without micro-payments, fans cannot support content creators with small donations, neither can they pay for watching just an episode of a series show nor access to limited content like a VIP club. The digital content industry needs a frictionless micro-payment system to cultivate an active and healthy community. 

In conclusion, current mainstream chains cannot serve as the foundation of a decentralized digital content ecosystem. To address the aforementioned challenges, CastBox will propose and lead the open source development of _BOX Chain_, a decentralized data and payment network that will benefit all the participants in the industry.

## BOX Chain

To make it very clear, we are NOT trying to build an upgraded Ethereum that meets any needs of various industries. Instead, the BOX Chain is built on a layered solution that aims to increase the scalability of the blockchain. While various transactions can be completed on the BOX Chain in a fast and reliable way, __the chain itself does not plan to support a general purpose Turing-complete virtual machine like EVM.__

Our design of the BOX Chain follows the __UNIX philosophy__: building a large system on top of a series of simple, modular, and reliable small parts. Instead of using a large, expensive-to-verify blockchain, we use small, parallel, mobile-friendly micro chains. Using programming language metaphor, __we can view Bitcoin as the C in the blockchain realm, while Ethereum as Java; then our BOX chain can be thought of as the Go in the blockchain world__. Just like go routines in the Go language, the micro chains will be tiny in terms of physical size and will be powerful as well. The micro chains will play the most important role in our BOX Chain. 

## Off-chain "Smart Contract"

Since the birth of Ethereum, smart contracts have been an indispensable part for many blockchain projects. However, most contracts need only one thing from the blockchain: an immutable ordering of commitments to prevent double-spending. Therefore, we decide to move the bulk of smart contracts off the chain. Instead of using complex and resource intensive smart contracts to align the interests of stakeholders and automate payment related transactions, we aggregate simple signatures to achieve the same goal but with much higher performance. By using signature itself as a witness, we can move the bulk of transactions off-chain and leave the blockchain to do what it is really good at: check a multi-sig. 

A crucial piece of this approach is Schnorr Signature[^fn1]. Unlike ECDSA, Schnorr signature has **linearity** in its math, which makes it ideal for creating "adaptor signature" that can be used in settling off-chain transactions automatically. Actually, based on the exciting progress made recently in this research area spearheaded by Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician from Blockstream, we are exploring this technology to build a light-weight but powerful blockchain that suits for the digital content industry. 

## BOX Passport

We are planning to build a powerful decentralized identity service called "BOX Passport", allowing the users to transact frictionlessly **across multiple apps or websites**. With the growth of the ContentBox ecosystem, a plethora of content applications are expected to be built atop ContentBox. A single user shall have a consistent identity across all of them, instead of having to create an independent identity for each application.

We establish the identity by extending the wallet concept to store personal information such as reputation besides token account. This identify service is not stored in any application’s centralized databases and inherently decentralized, less vulnerable to hacks. Users have full control on their identity and decide who can access which part of it for how long. Furthermore, BOX Passport will bind a creator to his artworks transparently and permanently, which helps him to build an ongoing reputation in the digital content world.

We will possibly integrate 3rd-party identity services such as Keybase[^fn3] and uPort[^fn2] into our identity service for broader interoperability.

# Use Case Examples Beyond CastBox

On the basis of BOX Chain and BOX Passport, many new type applications can be developed and deployed in the ContentBox ecosystem. Here we are listing a couple of simple examples. But definitely the open community will bring much more exciting applications in the future. 

## Decentralized Content Marketplace

Control of content distribution is concentrated in a few centralized marketplaces such as iTunes. 
These marketplaces unilaterally determine how creators are paid. As a result, the vast majority of the creators globally are greatly underpaid, if paid at all.

ContentBox allows for an open, fair, and creator-centric decentralized marketplace that enjoys many advantages over centralized counterpart.

+ Lower fee. Since there is no monopoly middleman rent seeking between creators and consumers, more revenue flows directly to creators.
+ More liquidity. In music industry, for example, it could take six to eighteen months before the first royalty check arrives at an artist after a song is released. In our new marketplace, an artist can be paid automatically in tradable built-in tokens while her song is being streamed, anywhere in the world.
+ More Transparency. Since all critical information is logged in a public blockchain, an artist can know exactly how many times and when her song is streamed, how much revenue it was generating. 

## Mini Crowd-funding 

Traditionally, creators have very limited ways to fund their creative projects and rely on powerful intermediaries such as music labels and film studios, which take a significant cut of the whole pie.

With ContentBox, creators can raise funding truly independently. A filmmaker can pre-sell tokens to fans to fund a film, which grant them access to the film once it is made. The crowdfunding smart contract can also include advanced features. For instance, fans can share a portion of the film revenue per their tokens. Or fans can specify funds to be gradually released, contingent on reaching production milestones. The same is applicable to other forms of creative endeavors such as music and TV shows.

# Token Distribution

Before the official launch of the native blockchain on the ContentBox Platform, BOX will be launched using Ethereum ERC 20 token standard. Once the main net of BOX Chain is online and stable, the ERC20 token will be converted to the chain token on a 1-1 basis.

# Risks

You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing BOX, holding BOX, and using BOX for participation in the ContentBox Platform.

_Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions_

The regulatory status of BOX and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform. Regulatory actions could negatively impact BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform in various ways. The Foundation (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies, the Foundation will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of BOX. Therefore, for the crowdsale, the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible. For the crowdsale, the Foundation is working with Tzedek Law LLC, a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain space.

_Competitors_

It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar code and protocol underlying BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The ContentBox Platform may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform.

_Loss of Talent_

The development of the ContentBox Platform depends on the continued co-operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect the ContentBox Platform or its future development.

_Failure to Develop_

There is the risk that the development of the ContentBox Platform will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or BOX, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

_Security Weaknesses_

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Foundation or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform, which could negatively affect BOX and/or the ContentBox Platform.

_Other Risks_

In addition to the aforementioned risks, there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Token Purchase Agreement) associated with your purchase, holding and use of BOX, including those that the Foundation cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the Foundation (and its affiliates), the ContentBox team, understand the overall framework and vision for the ContentBox Platform prior to purchasing BOX.
